## Get the Flutter SDK {#get-sdk}

{% include docs/china-notice.md %}

Install Flutter on Linux using one of the following two methods.
After installation, verify your environment setup.

### Method 1: Install Flutter using snapd

This offers the most direct method to install Flutter on Linux.

1. Install `snapd` if you don't have it installed.
   To learn about using snapd, check [Installing snapd][].

1. Install Flutter from the Snap Store or use the following command:

   ```terminal
   $ sudo snap install flutter --classic
   ```

1. After you install the snap,
   check your Flutter SDK path with the following command:

   ```terminal
   $ flutter doctor -v | grep "Flutter version"
   ```
 
   The output should resemble the following:
 
   ```terminal
   • Flutter version 3.13.4 on channel stable at <your-path>/flutter
   ```

{{site.alert.note}}
  Only use `snapd` to install Flutter.
  To upgrade Flutter, run `flutter upgrade`.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Method 2: Install from archive file

If you don't have or can't use `snapd`, follow these steps to install Flutter.

1. Download the installation bundle for the latest
   {{site.sdk.channel}} release of the Flutter SDK:

   [(loading...)](#){:.download-latest-link-{{os}}.btn.btn-primary}

   You can find older builds and other release channels in the [SDK archive][].

2. Extract the downloaded file to a location of your choice:

    ```terminal
    $ cd ~/development
    $ tar xf ~/Downloads/flutter_{{os}}_vX.X.X-{{site.sdk.channel}}.tar.xz
    ```

3. Add the `flutter` tool to your path:

    ```terminal
    $ export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
    ```

    This command sets your `PATH` environment variable for the current
    terminal window only.
    To add Flutter as permenant part of your path,
    check out [Update your path][].

4. (Optional) Pre-download development binaries:

    ```terminal
    $ flutter precache
    ```

    To find additional download options, run `flutter help precache`.

{{site.alert.note}}
  To update an existing version of Flutter, see [Upgrading Flutter][].
{{site.alert.end}}

### Post Installation: Run flutter doctor

After installing Flutter, run `flutter doctor`.
This command checks your environment and displays a report in the
terminal window.
Flutter bundles the Dart SDK. You don't need to install Dart.
Review the output for further tasks to perform.

For verbose output, add the `-v` flag:

```terminal
$ flutter doctor
```

The output might resemble the following:

```terminal
[-] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    • Android SDK at /Users/dash/Library/Android/sdk
    <strong>✗ Android SDK is missing command line tools; download from https://goo.gl/XxQghQ</strong>
    • Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,
      visit {{site.url}}/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
```

After installing any missing dependencies,
run the `flutter doctor` command again.
